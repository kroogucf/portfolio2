Dylan Portfolio 2 Assignment

I chose to "Converting a project not currently using React Navigation to use stacks or drawers with at least three new components. Each component in the new version should use state."

The two previous projects I used are, firstly the project I chose to convert is from week 12 where we created the TODO app with FlatList and CheckBoxes to use react navigation, specifically stack navigation from week13

3 New components are

1. Login System (It accepts any username and password for ease of access, but have to be something in each field or won't login. Takes place in LoginApp.js)
2. Journal Entry Page. This is where user can type in a title, body of text, and a date for a journal entry (Takes place in JournalMain.js and NewJournalPost.js)
3. Component that displays and styles journal entries to the user. (Takes place in JournalPost.js)
